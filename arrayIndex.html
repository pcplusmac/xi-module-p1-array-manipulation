            <h3>how to create the first-class-function?</h3>
            <p>
               a function used as a parameter on it's name for other function -- a function being passed around
               <strong>note: </strong> alternatively, it can be assign to a const variable this variable is the name of the function, which means that 
               on the right side of equator can be just an anonymous function contain the logic of the function. <u>But without assigning function to a 
               variable, it can be also used as first-class function by using it's name. </u>  
            </p>
            <h3>why do we do use this? </h3>
            <p>
                the reason for creating first-class-function is:  
                 <ul>
                    <li>it is the function that can be pass around as the parameter for other function; such as 'loopThrough'</li>
                    <li>besides it can be passed around as a parameter, it can still keep the original feature as 
                        a function -- to be invoked by using it's name with parenthesis following by. 
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>

            <h3>how to use it? the benefits of usage on it. </h3>
            <p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>usage 1: inovke the method -- this is the normal usage of function name</li>
                    <li>usage 2: inject the function's logic to other function by passing this parameter to other function.</li>
                    <li>usage 3: increasing the flexibility for other function, this is alike the 'interface' in other languages,
                        such as: handleArray() can take difference first-class methods to change the way of handling the array. </li>
                     
                </ul>

            <h3>how does first-class function work on a collection of objects?</h3>
            <p>this is a bit more complicated comparing with handling the array, because we need to consider how to access the value of the object property by using its key.</p>

            <h3>somethings must be clear for successful on without using find(): </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <u><strong>how to stop the loop.</strong></u> it is to find the first-matching 
                    element, so the for loop must be stopped when the first matching element found. it can
                    done by uisng eiter "break", or 'return' keyword.

                <li>
                    <u><strong>How to return and use the boolean type restult.</strong></u> in verifying the condition that element found, boolean type expression is best, so 
                    need to understand the uage of logical operator, they return only boolean result.
